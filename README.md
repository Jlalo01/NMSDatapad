# NMSDatapad
Very basic app designed to be a companion for No Man's Sky players

## Description 
A very basic app (my first app) designed to support while playing a videogame "No Man's Sky". The idea for the app is to act as a companion, a pad that records information about the systems visited and can be used to quickly search for information the player might want to access as he continues to discover and progress in the game.
